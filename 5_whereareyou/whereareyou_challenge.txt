You need to declare and implement a service with an intent filter with action com.mobiotsec.intent.action.GIMMELOCATION. The system will find your service and it will start it with a startForegroundService() method (and an appropriate intent as argument). The system expects to get back the current location (as a Location object).

During the test, the system will change the current location at run-time and it will query your service to get the updated location. If the expected location matches with what you reply back, the flag will be printed in the logs.

Your service should "return" the reply to the system with a broadcast intent, with a specific action and bundle, as in the snippet below:

Location currLoc = getCurrentLocation(); // put your magic here
Intent i = new Intent();
i.setAction("com.mobiotsec.intent.action.LOCATION_ANNOUNCEMENT");
i.putExtra("location", currLoc);
sendBroadcast(i);
